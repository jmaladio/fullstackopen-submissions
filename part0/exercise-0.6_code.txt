User enters text on
the input field and

The JS code fetched earlier
grabs the data, prevents the
traditional POST method which 
would generate a new GET circuit,
and renders the new note.
end note

note over Browser:
The JS parses the new note object
into a JSON document and instructs
the browser to send it to the server.
end note
